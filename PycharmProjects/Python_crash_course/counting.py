# Introducing while loops.

# We can use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers.
current_number = 1
# Python will repeat the loop as long as the condition is met.
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1

# This program will print out each number from 1-5 inclusive on a new line.
