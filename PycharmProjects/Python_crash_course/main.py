# A dictionary in python is a collection of key-value pairs
# Each key is connected to a value and you can use the key to access the value associated with the key.

# Accessing Values in a Dictionary To get the value associated with a key, we give the name of the dictionary,
# and then place the key inside a set of square brackets.

# Adding new key-value pairs

alien_0['x_position '] = 0
alien_0['y_position'] = 25
print(alien_0)

# Starting with an empty dictionary

alien_0 = {}

alien_0['color'] = 'green'
alien_0['points'] = 5
print(alien_0)

# Here were starting with an empty dictionary and then adding the color and point values to it.
