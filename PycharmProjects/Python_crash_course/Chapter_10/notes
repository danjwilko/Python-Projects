Using json.dump() and json.load()

The json.dump() function takes two arguments: a piece of data to store and
a file object it can use to store the data
We use  the json.load() function to read the data back into memory.

Saving and reading user generated Data

Saving data with json is useful when your working with user generated data,
because if you dont store your users information somehow, you'll lose it when
the programs stop running.

Refactoring
Often, you'll come to a point where your code will wor, but you recognise that
you could improve the code by breaking it up into a series of functions that have specific jobs.
The process is called refactoring.
Refactoring makes your code cleaner and easier to extend.
