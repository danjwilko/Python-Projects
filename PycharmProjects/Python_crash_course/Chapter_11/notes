Unit tests and Test cases

the module unittest from the python standard library provides tools for testing your code.
A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a function's behavior is correct.
A test case is a collaction if unit tests that together prove that a function behaves as it supposed to
within the full range of situations you expect it to handle.
