Since I finished the Algorithms and data structures with python module as part of my University studies, I decided to go over the python basics.
In part to keep practicing and keep away skill fade but also to ensure I dont skip any of the basics, since the module taught python to a point but
its overall aim was teach the understanding of how to think regarding algorithms and data structures.
